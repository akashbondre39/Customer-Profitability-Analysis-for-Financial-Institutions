**Customer Profitability Analysis for Financial Institutions**


Business Understanding:

Financial institutions often struggle to optimize their profitability due to an uneven distribution of revenue generation across customer segments. While some customers contribute significantly through loan repayments, credit card usage, and investment activities, others may be less profitable or even unprofitable due to high costs of service, defaults, or low engagement with financial products.
The objective is to identify the most profitable customer segments, analyze behaviors that drive profitability, and develop targeted strategies to improve overall business outcomes. By leveraging customer profitability analysis, the institution can better allocate resources, minimize churn among high-value customers, and design strategies for converting low-value customers into more profitable ones.
