# Customer Profitability Analysis for Financial Institutions

Performed advanced exploratory data analysis on customer transaction data to identify high-value segments, analyze revenue-generation patterns, and recommend data-driven strategies for improving customer profitability and retention. Below is overview of the project in this repository.

## Business Understanding:

Financial institutions often struggle to optimize their profitability due to an uneven distribution of revenue generation across customer segments. While some customers contribute significantly through loan repayments, credit card usage, and investment activities, others may be less profitable or even unprofitable due to high costs of service, defaults, or low engagement with financial products.
The objective is to identify the most profitable customer segments, analyze behaviors that drive profitability, and develop targeted strategies to improve overall business outcomes. By leveraging customer profitability analysis, the institution can better allocate resources, minimize churn among high-value customers, and design strategies for converting low-value customers into more profitable ones.


## Dataset Overview

## Stages

### Data Cleaning


### Outlier Detection


### Feature Engineering

In this step, we create derived features to enrich the dataset and improve analysis namely :

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: This metric is calculated as the product of average monthly revenue and customer tenure, reflecting the total revenue potential of a customer over their relationship with the bank.

**Debt-to-Income Ratio**: This is computed as total debt divided by annual income, helping assess a customerâ€™s financial stability and credit risk.
These features provide deeper insights into customer profitability and risk, enhancing the effectiveness of the analysis.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Univariate Analysis

Univariate analysis examines each feature individually to understand its distribution, central tendency, and variability. For example, analyzing Annual_Income or Risk_Score helps identify patterns, assess feature importance for customer profitability.

-Distribution of Age

-Customer Segmentation Distribution

-Annual Income Distribution

-Distribution of Debt-Income Ratio

-Distribution of Customer Profitability

-Churn Rate Distribution

-CLV distribution

#### Bivariate Analysis

Bivariate analysis will help identify relationships and correlations between two variables. In this project, it can reveal how factors like CLV, Debt-to-Income Ratio, or Risk Score vary with churn status. This helps in understanding which features are most influential in predicting customer churn or profitability.

### Overall Insights

1. Churn Analysis 85% of customers are retained, while 15% have churned, indicating a strong customer retention rate. However, strategies to target the churned customers can improve overall profitability and reduce customer acquisition costs.
2. Customer Profitability Distribution The average customer profitability is USD 12,500 per year, with 25% of customers contributing more than USD 18,000 annually (high-profitability segment).On the other hand, 20% of customers exhibit negative profitability, with losses averaging USD3,000 annually.3
3.Debt-to-Income Ratio vs Risk Score Customers with a debt-to-income ratio above 0.4 show a 20% higher average risk score, and 30% of them are more likely to churn compared to customers with a lower ratio.
4. Customer Segment Insights The Premium Segment contributes 40% of total profitability, with an average profitability of USD 20,000 per customer annually.The Young Professionals Segment has a lower profitability, averaging USD 6,000 per customer, but presents an opportunity for cross-selling and long-term growth.
5. Revenue vs Costs On average, customers generate USD 25,000 in total annual revenue, with associated costs averaging USD 13,500 per year, yielding a profit margin of 46%. Customers with high customer support interactions (over 10 interactions per year) have 20% lower profitability, indicating a need to optimize support costs.
6. Risk Score and Profitability Customers with a Risk Score below 40 contribute 70% of total profitability, while those with a Risk Score above 60 have 15% lower average profitability and a 25% higher churn rate.
7. Employment Status and Profitability Salaried employees are the most profitable, with an average profitability of USD 14,500 per year, compared to USD 9,800 for self-employed customers. This indicates potential for tailored financial solutions for self-employed individuals.
8. Digital Banking Adoption Customers actively using digital banking services contribute USD 2,500 more in profitability annually than non-digital users. Increasing adoption rates from the current 60% to 75% could add USD 2.5 million annually in profitability (for 100,000 customers).

10. HNW Customers HNW Segment accounts for 50% of total profitability, despite comprising only 20% of the customer base.The average annual profitability per HNW customer is USD 25,000, which is 1.5x higher than Private Banking customers and 3x higher than Retail customers. HNW customers have an 80% adoption rate of investment accounts, contributing significantly to their overall profitability. Churn in the HNW segment is minimal at 5%, suggesting strong loyalty. However, retaining these customers is critical due to their outsized impact on revenue.
11. Private Banking Customers Private Banking Segment represents 30% of the customer base, contributing 35% of overall profitability with an average profitability of $18,000 per customer annually. Customers in this segment exhibit 15% churn, higher than the HNW segment but lower than the Retail segment.

 Customers with more than 10 customer support interactions annually are 15% more likely to churn, suggesting dissatisfaction with resolution efficiency.
-Cross-Selling Potential:
 Promoting tailored mortgage plans or low-deposit investment options to younger Private Banking customers (age 30â€“40) could yield an additional $8 million annually across the segment.
